### Git Workflow

For the development workflow, the team has decided to follow a feature branch
strategy.

Each time an addition needs to be made to the code in the main branch, a new
branch is to be created with a meaningful name that incorporates the nature of
the change and the name and ID of the corresponding issue in Jira, for example:

- EKZ-11/feat/login (this task is a feature, its Jira issue ID is EKZ-11, and it
  implements the login feature)
- docs/meeting-notes-sep-2 (this is a documentation update for the meeting notes
  from September second)
- EKZ-24/fix/login (this is a bug fix for the login feature, with a Jira issue
  ID of EKZ-24)

For each commit, the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
standard must be followed.
